🎯 Motto: Play the Math, Not the Emotion
 📌 Applies to: Video Poker (especially Jacks or Better)
This strategy is a collection of rule-of-thumb decisions to help you make smarter plays in Video Poker. It's not a guaranteed path to winning but follows general principles based on probability.
⚠️ Disclaimer: This is not a mathematically perfect strategy. These are simplified heuristics designed to improve casual play and teach core concepts. Always play responsibly.

✅ 1. Always Hold a Paying Hand
If you're dealt a hand that already earns a payout, lock it in.
Paying hands include:
Jacks or Better (J-J, Q-Q, etc.)
Two Pair
Three of a Kind
Straight
Flush
Full House
Four of a Kind
Straight Flush or Royal Flush
🃏 Examples:
J♣ J♦ 4♠ 8♥ 2♦ → Hold both Jacks
K♦ K♠ 3♥ 3♣ 7♣ → Hold all (Two Pair)
2♣ 3♣ 4♣ 5♣ 6♣ → Straight Flush, keep it all


🚫 Don't chase a "better" hand like a Full House if you're already getting paid — the odds aren't worth it.

🔥 2. Chase High-Value Draws (If You Don’t Have a Made Hand)
If you’re one card away from something big, it’s worth holding the draw.
Draws worth chasing:
4 to a Royal Flush
4 to a Straight Flush
4 to a Flush
🃏 Examples:
10♠ J♠ Q♠ K♠ 3♦ → Hold four spades
3♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ Q♣ → Hold 3♦–6♦ (Straight Flush draw)
A♣ 5♣ 7♣ 10♣ 2♥ → Hold the four clubs
🚨 Yes, it’s okay to break a low pair if you’re drawing to a huge hand.

🧪 3. Break Low Pairs Only for Stronger Draws
Sometimes a small win isn’t worth more than the chance at something better.
Break low pairs (2s–10s) if you have:
4 to a Flush
4 to an Open-Ended Straight
4 to a Straight Flush
🃏 Examples:
5♠ 5♦ 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ → Break the pair, hold suited draw
8♥ 8♣ 9♥ 10♥ J♥ → Break the pair, hold 9♥–J♥
🚫 Don't break a pair for weak hands like inside straights (e.g., 4-6-7-8) or disconnected off-suit cards.

👑 4. Hold One High Card (Only If You Have Nothing Else)
If your hand is junk, keep a single high card for a chance to pair up.
High cards: Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces

🃏 Examples:
K♣ 4♠ 7♦ 9♣ 2♥ → Hold the King
Q♠ 6♦ 3♠ 5♥ 10♦ → Hold the Queen

🚫 Don’t hold:
Multiple unpaired high cards
Unconnected low cards
Inside straights without a flush chance

💰 5. Bet Max to Unlock the Royal Flush Bonus
Royal Flushes only pay the full jackpot when you bet max coins.
Bet 1–4 coins → Royal Flush pays ~250–1000 credits
Bet 5 coins → Royal Flush pays 4000 credits 💥
 (That’s $1000 on a quarter machine!)
💡 If you're low on funds:
Play fewer hands at max bet
Or find a lower denomination machine

🚫 Don’t short-change a Royal Flush with a low bet!

🧠 Quick Reference – What to Hold First
Situation - Best Move
